# My new portfolio website
I've taken everything that I have learn over the past few years and put them together to create a portfolio website! I started my career as a fashion designer, and wanted to hightlight this and it is a huge part of my creativity.

I used a lot of SVG code to replace images, and keep the website as fexible as possible. This means, if in the future, I want a completely new colour scheme, I can adapt all of my icons to that colour scheme too.
